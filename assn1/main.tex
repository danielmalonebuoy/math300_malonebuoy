\section*{Description:}
These snickerdoodle cookies are so delicious, and they have the best texture. They are so fast to put together too! I actually got it from an old recipe that my Great-grandma had clipped out of a newspaper. Grandma always knows best!

\section*{Ingredients:}  
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 cup of butter 
\item 1.5 cups of sugar 
\item 2 large eggs 
\item 2.75 cups of flour 
\item 2 teaspoons of cream of tartar 
\item 1 teaspoon of baking soda 
\item .25 teaspoon of salt 
\item 3 tablespoons of sugar 
\item 3 teaspoons of cinnamon 
\item 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
\end{itemize}

\section*{Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Preheat oven to 350Â°F.  
\item Mix butter, 1.5 cups of sugar, 1 teaspoons of vanilla extract and eggs thoroughly in a large bowl.
\item Combine flour, cream of tartar, baking soda and salt in a separate bowl.
\item Blend dry ingredients into butter mixture.
\item Chill dough, and chill an ungreased cookie sheet for about 10-15 minutes in the fridge.
\item Meanwhile, mix 3 tablespoons sugar, and 3 teaspoons cinnamon in a small bowl.
\item Scoop 1 inch globs of dough into the sugar and cinnamon mixture.
\item Coat by gently rolling balls of dough in the sugar mixture.
